# Summary
Logi is a highly parallel, adaptive mesh, multiphysics
simulation code for compressible fusion flows. It was forked from the repository of  
the astrophysical code Castro.

# Statement of Need

A comprehensive Open Source code for fusion reaction calculation is not yet available. We want to create one.

# Acknowledgments
